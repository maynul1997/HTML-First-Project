<p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, <strong>which affects the behavior</strong> and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former <em>maintainer</em> of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the element, together with JavaScript.</p>
